# WallhavenSetter

See [the API docs](https://wallhaven.cc/help/api#search) for guidance to set up 
custom parameters. Each parameter can be set in the 'payload' key of the 
cofiguration file.

If you prefer a different wallpaper setter, you can change it in the 
`config.json` file as well. Should allow for usage of Wayland compatible setters.
